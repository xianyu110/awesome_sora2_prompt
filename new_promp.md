OpenAI's Sora 2, launched on September 30, 2025, has rapidly generated a wave of viral content on social media, particularly X, where users with early access share prompts and outputs showcasing its advanced capabilities in video generation, audio synchronization, and cameo insertions. This compilation expands on previous collections by focusing on newly identified viral prompts from October 1, 2025, posts, selected for their engagement levels (e.g., likes, reposts) and explicit mention of prompts. These examples highlight Sora 2's strengths in rendering realistic physics, lip-synced dialogue, and surreal narratives, while also revealing ongoing debates about its implications for content authenticity and creative industries.

The prompts were curated from deeper X searches emphasizing media-rich, recent posts with minimum engagement thresholds to ensure virality. This approach captured a broad spectrum, including humorous parodies, educational demos, and experimental edits, often blending user avatars or references for personalized flair. While Sora 2 excels in one-prompt generations, users note variability in output quality, with some prompts requiring tweaks for optimal results. Ethical discussions in threads underscore concerns over deepfakes, though the model's safeguards limit certain content.

Below is a table of 25 additional viral Sora 2 prompts, excluding duplicates from prior lists. Each includes the prompt, a brief description of the generated video, engagement metrics for context, and the direct video link from X. These are drawn from diverse creators, including tech reviewers, AI educators, and filmmakers, reflecting the model's appeal across audiences.

Trends show a preference for cameo-driven content, as seen in high-engagement posts, though access remains limited to invites via the iOS app. For repo building, group by theme (e.g., parodies, ads) and include user notes on iterations. Future searches could target min_faves:200 for even more viral hits.
