## üé¨ What is Sora?

Sora is OpenAI's text-to-video generation model that acts as a "world simulator," capable of creating realistic and imaginative videos from text prompts. **Sora 2**, released on September 30, 2025, introduces:

- **Synchronized Audio**: Natural sound effects and dialogue generation
- **Enhanced Physics**: Improved realism in motion and object interactions
- **Self-Insertion Cameos**: Ability to insert custom avatars
- **Advanced Controllability**: More precise camera work and cinematic control

## üéØ Core Principles

### The Five Pillars of Effective Sora Prompts

Based on analysis of official and viral prompts, every effective Sora prompt should include:

1. **Subject & Character**: Define WHO or WHAT (appearance, clothing, emotions)
2. **Action & Motion**: Describe WHAT IS HAPPENING (verbs, movements, interactions)
3. **Environment & Setting**: Establish WHERE and WHEN (location, time, atmosphere)
4. **Cinematic Framing**: Define HOW IT'S SEEN (camera angles, movements, shots)
5. **Aesthetic & Style**: Determine LOOK and FEEL (photorealistic, animated, film stock)

### The "World Simulator" Paradigm

Sora isn't just generating videos‚Äîit's simulating miniature, self-consistent worlds. Effective prompts should:

- Provide initial conditions and physical laws
- Specify how objects interact with each other
- Define environmental properties (gravity, lighting, reflections)
- Guide the physics implicitly or explicitly

### Prompt Length Strategy

- **Creative Exploration** (< 120 words): Best for imaginative, story-driven scenes
- **Precision Execution** (> 200 words): Best for cinematic control and technical accuracy
