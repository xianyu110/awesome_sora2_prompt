## Sora 1 Official Prompts

### Tokyo Walk

**Full Prompt:**
```
A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about.

### Big Sur Coastline

**Full Prompt:**
```
Drone view of waves crashing against the rugged cliffs along Big Sur's garay point beach. The crashing blue waters create white-tipped waves, while the golden light of the setting sun illuminates the rocky shore. A small island with a lighthouse sits in the distance, and green shrubbery covers the cliff's edge. The steep drop from the road down to the beach is a dramatic feat, with the cliff's edges jutting out over the sea. This is a view that captures the raw beauty of the coast and the rugged landscape of the Pacific Coast Highway.

### Monster with Melting Candle

**Full Prompt:**
```
Animated scene features a close-up of a short fluffy monster kneeling beside a melting red candle. The art style is 3D and realistic, with a focus on lighting and texture. The mood of the painting is one of wonder and curiosity, as the monster gazes at the flame with wide eyes and open mouth. Its pose and expression convey a sense of innocence and playfulness, as if it is exploring the world around it for the first time. The use of warm colors and dramatic lighting further enhances the cozy atmosphere of the image.

## Sora 2 Official Prompts

### Dragon over Glacier

**Full Prompt:**
```
Primary Target & Visuals:
a dragon slicing past serrated ice spires jutting from a glacier, trailing embers that flare in its wake like fireflies, wings spread wide casting shadows on the sunlit ice below, arcing low over a deep fjord, the gap between its belly and the water barely a wingspan, steep walls looming on either side

Format & Appearance:
4K resolution, large-format digital sensor emulation, aspherical 50mm lens, fine grain simulation

Camera & Filter:
nose-mounted gimbal-stabilized aerial platform, tracking shot POV, 1/8 Black Pro-Mist filter for a gentle halation on highlights

Grading & Palette:
neutral to cool-temperature color palette (glacial blues, slate grays, pale mist whites), warm accents only on embers and reflected sunlight

Lighting & Atmosphere:
indirect natural light from late-afternoon sun angled low, subtle god-rays breaking through mist layers, soft atmospheric perspective fading distant peaks
```

**Video Link:** [View on OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/sora-2/)

#### Analysis

This prompt represents the evolution of prompt engineering from description to complete technical specification. It's structured in sections:

1. **Primary Target & Visuals**: Establishes the core scene and dramatic action
2. **Format & Appearance**: Specifies technical output parameters
3. **Camera & Filter**: Defines virtual cinematography equipment
4. **Grading & Palette**: Provides post-production color instructions
5. **Lighting & Atmosphere**: Sets environmental lighting conditions

#### Key Innovations

- **System-Level Specification**: Not just describing WHAT to create, but HOW to create it
- **Professional Workflow**: Mimics a complete film production pipeline in text
- **Technical Precision**: Uses industry-standard terminology (gimbal, Pro-Mist filter, color grading)
- **Multi-Dimensional Control**: Simultaneously controls subject, camera, lighting, and post-production

This represents the future direction of Sora 2 prompting: from scene description to production simulation.

### Mountaineers Calling Out

**Full Prompt:**
```
Two mountain climbing explorers in red parkas stumble through fresh snow drifts in sequence, each calling out loudly into the white expanse as they climb toward a ridge
```

**Video Link:** [View on OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/sora-2/)

#### Five Pillars Analysis

| Pillar | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Subject** | Two mountain climbers in red parkas |
| **Action** | Stumbling through snow in sequence, calling out loudly |
| **Environment** | Fresh snow drifts, white expanse, climbing toward ridge |
| **Cinematic** | Not explicitly specified |
| **Aesthetic** | Realistic outdoor adventure |

#### Key Innovation: Audio Integration

- **Audio Specification**: "calling out loudly" explicitly requests synchronized dialogue/sound
- **Sequential Action**: "in sequence" guides the temporal choreography
- **Environmental Sound Implied**: Snow, wind, and echo are implicitly suggested by the setting

This demonstrates Sora 2's new audio capabilities, marking the transition from "silent film" to "sound film" in generative video.

## Prompt Engineering Lessons

### From Sora 1 Prompts

1. **Sensory details matter**: Temperature, texture, reflections enhance realism
2. **Implicit physics work**: Guide material properties indirectly
3. **Cinematic terms are powerful**: Camera angles, lens specs dramatically affect output
4. **Brevity can win**: Simple prompts with strong concepts ("papercraft world") are highly effective

### From Sora 2 Prompts

1. **Structure your prompt**: Use sections for complex specifications
2. **Think like a production team**: Specify not just content, but camera, lighting, and post-production
3. **Audio is now part of the prompt**: Explicitly describe sounds, dialogue, and audio cues
4. **Technical vocabulary works**: Industry terms (gimbal, color grading, film stock) are understood

### Universal Principles

- Always include clear subject, action, and environment
- Use specific rather than vague descriptors
- Guide physics through material and behavior descriptions
- Match prompt complexity to your goal (creative exploration vs. precision execution)
