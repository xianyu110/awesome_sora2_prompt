## Coastal & Ocean

### Big Sur Coastline

**Prompt:**
```
Drone view of waves crashing against the rugged cliffs along Big Sur's garay point
beach. The crashing blue waters create white-tipped waves, while the golden light
of the setting sun illuminates the rocky shore. A small island with a lighthouse
sits in the distance, and green shrubbery covers the cliff's edge. The steep drop
from the road down to the beach is a dramatic feat, with the cliff's edges jutting
out over the sea. This is a view that captures the raw beauty of the coast and the
rugged landscape of the Pacific Coast Highway.

### Ocean Storm

**Prompt:**
```
Cinematic footage of massive waves during a storm in the North Atlantic. Dark, turbulent
waters rise into 30-foot swells, white foam and spray flying off the crests. Low,
ominous clouds race overhead. Camera mounted on ship bow, rising and falling with the
swells, creating visceral sense of power and danger. Shot on weatherproof cinema camera,
high shutter speed captures water droplets frozen in mid-air. Dramatic, documentary-style
cinematography emphasizing nature's raw power.
```

**Prompt Type:** Precision Execution

**Key Techniques:**
- Specific wave height (30-foot) provides scale reference
- Weather integration (low clouds, spray)
- Camera position specified (ship bow) for immersive POV
- Technical specs (high shutter speed) for desired water capture
- Mood guidance (power, danger, raw)

```
Aerial drone shot soaring over a pristine mountain range at dawn. Fresh snow covers
jagged peaks that catch the first pink and orange light of sunrise. Camera glides
smoothly between peaks, revealing valleys filled with morning mist below. A frozen
alpine lake reflects the colorful sky like a mirror. Pine trees at lower elevations
are frosted with snow. Thin clouds drift between peaks. Cinematic, IMAX-quality
landscape cinematography, shot on large format digital camera with exceptional clarity.
```

**Prompt Type:** Precision Execution

**Analysis:**

### Autumn Forest Path

**Prompt:**
```
Steadicam shot gliding down a winding forest path in peak autumn. Trees ablaze with
red, orange, and yellow foliage create a natural tunnel overhead. Fallen leaves carpet
the ground in thick layers, some lifted by a gentle breeze swirling around the camera.
Shafts of warm afternoon sunlight pierce through gaps in the canopy, illuminating
floating leaves and creating volumetric light beams. Camera moves forward at walking
pace, smooth and steady, inviting viewer to take a peaceful journey. Shot on 35mm film
with rich, saturated fall colors.
```

**Prompt Type:** Precision Execution

**Key Elements:**
- Seasonal specificity (peak autumn)
- Rich color description (red, orange, yellow)
- Dynamic elements (breeze, floating leaves, light beams)
- Camera movement (steadicam, walking pace)
- Film stock and color direction

## Urban Landscapes

### Tokyo Night Streets

**Prompt:**
```
A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated
city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and
carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and
casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful
lights. Many pedestrians walk about.
```

**Source:** OpenAI Official (The most iconic Sora prompt)

**Analysis:**
This legendary prompt's success stems from:
- **Sensory Details:** "warm glowing neon" sets color temperature
- **Material Properties:** "damp and reflective" guides light physics
- **Character Specificity:** Detailed clothing ensures consistency
- **Environmental Depth:** Multiple layers (subject, pedestrians, signs, reflections)
- **Implicit Physics:** Reflection effect provides surface and light behavior guidance

### New York City Rush Hour

**Prompt:**
```
Time-lapse of New York City intersection during evening rush hour. Camera locked in
high position looking down at busy crosswalk. Yellow taxis, pedestrians, cyclists all
flow through frame in accelerated motion. Traffic lights cycle from red to green.
Street lights turn on as sky transitions from blue hour to night. Long exposure effect
creates light trails from vehicles. Urban energy and rhythm of the city compressed into
dynamic time-lapse. Sharp focus throughout, deep depth of field showing entire scene.
```

**Prompt Type:** Creative Exploration

**Techniques:**
- Time-lapse specification changes temporal dynamics
- Static camera (locked position) for stability
- Multiple moving elements (taxis, pedestrians, cyclists)
- Light transition (blue hour to night)
- Long exposure effect for light trails

## Aerial & Drone Views

### Vineyard Landscape

**Prompt:**
```
Breathtaking drone shot rising over Tuscan vineyard at golden hour. Camera starts low
between rows of grapevines, their leaves deep green and grapes hanging full. Slowly
ascends while rotating, revealing geometric patterns of planted rows stretching to
horizon. Medieval stone farmhouse and cypress trees come into view. Rolling hills in
background catch warm sunset light. Shadows lengthen across the landscape. Smooth,
cinematic drone operation with slow, majestic movement. Colors rich and saturated,
emphasizing Mediterranean warmth.

## Tips for Hyperrealistic Landscapes

### Do's ✅

1. **Specify Lighting Conditions:** Golden hour, blue hour, overcast, harsh midday
2. **Include Atmospheric Elements:** Fog, mist, dust, rain, snow
3. **Define Camera Movement Precisely:** Speed, direction, smoothness
4. **Add Dynamic Elements:** Wind, water, clouds, wildlife
5. **Specify Film Stock or Digital Format:** 35mm, IMAX, cinema camera
6. **Use Reference Locations:** Specific places help model understand aesthetic
7. **Include Reflections and Shadows:** Guide light physics

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't Forget Scale:** Without scale references, landscapes feel flat
2. **Don't Ignore Time of Day:** Lighting drastically affects mood
3. **Don't Use Static Descriptions:** Landscapes need movement (wind, water, camera)
4. **Don't Overload with Detail:** Focus on 3-5 key elements maximum
5. **Don't Forget Depth:** Foreground, midground, background create dimension
