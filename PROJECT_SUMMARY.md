## 🎨 Core Frameworks Implemented

### The Five Pillars of Effective Prompts
1. **Subject & Character** - WHO or WHAT
2. **Action & Motion** - WHAT IS HAPPENING
3. **Environment & Setting** - WHERE and WHEN
4. **Cinematic Framing** - HOW IT'S SEEN
5. **Aesthetic & Style** - LOOK and FEEL

### The World Simulator Paradigm
- Prompts should describe complete miniature worlds
- Include physics, lighting, and material properties
- Guide interactions between elements
- Think like a director + physicist

### Prompt Type Classification
- **Creative Exploration** (< 120 words): Open-ended, imaginative
- **Precision Execution** (> 200 words): Technical, controlled
